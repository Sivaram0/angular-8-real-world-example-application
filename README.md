# angular-realtime-app
The main purpose of this repository is to show a design and develop real-time application using latest **angular** version, use this application as a reference when you start a new project OR you want to improve code quality of your existing application. We will try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, but community contributions and recommendations for improvements are encouraged and will be most welcome.

```
https://github.com/balajihambeere/express-mongo-nodejs-es-realtime-app

```

- Install dependencies

```
cd <project_name>
npm install

```

- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)
