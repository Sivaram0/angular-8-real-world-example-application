# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
 
```
git clone https://github.com/balajihambeere/angular-realtime-app.git <project_name>

```
- Follow the readme on below link to **clone & run** the backend repository
 
```
https://github.com/balajihambeere/express-mongo-nodejs-es-realtime-app

```

- Install dependencies

```
cd <project_name>
npm install

```

- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)

```
mongod

```
- Run the backend project

```
npm start
```
 Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the server started locally!


- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```
ng serve
```

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

```
ng build
```

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

```
ng test
```
- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

```
